## First Holiday Ltd Chat Agent

### by Hannah Lynn

This project is a Holiday Chat Agent for First Holiday Ltd.

You can see a working prototype video of the project by going to my portfolio.

The chat can be opened by pressing the "Chat Now" tab. The chat can be closed by pressing the x in the the top right hand corner of the chat window.

You can also refresh the chat by pressing the arrow in the top left of the chat window.

If you close or refresh the chat the previous conversation will be deleted.

To talk to the bot, you can open the chat and answer their questions.

If a question is asked and a button appears, you must click one of the buttons to proceed. If a number is required, you must enter a number to proceed.

Once you have reached the end of the bot questions it will recommend you some holidays if your answers match any of the data. If not, you can start again.

The chat can be downloaded into a text file using the save button in the bottom left of the chat.

At the end of the conversation you can also type your own questions and see if the bot can help you.

Why not try asking the bot their name? Or if they are hungry.

You can also ask the bot something else, but they may not always have an answer, after all, they are just a bot.
